ENVELOPE SCRIPT
This is mostly done now.

POTS AUTOMATION
--Use cases--
-Use case 1, pots to envelopes-
* User enters total transfer amount
* Interface has two columns:
From savings pots    |   To checking envelopes

* The columns either list all the pots/envelopes, or it has pulldowns that allow you to add new pots/envelopes
* Each row within the column as the pulldown and a text field. The text field is where you enter the amount.
* at the bottom (or top?) you have a running total of the pots/envelopes you've entered so far.
* 

UI Mockup. 'v' means pulldown.

-Use case 2, envelopes to pots-

-Use case 3, checking/paycheck to pots-

-Use case 4, pots to checking balance, manual envelope adjustment-
This one might be the most practical. It's also probably one of the easiest to implement. You might want to start with it.
* Manually enter the amount you're taking out of savings
* The tool enters the new savings balance
* OR
* Enter the new savings balance
* 

TODO: 
* How about a UI? 
* Flesh out the above use cases more.

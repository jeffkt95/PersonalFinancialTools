# PersonalFinancialTools
A set of tools for my personal finances.

ENVELOPE SCRIPT
This is mostly done now.

POTS AUTOMATION
--Use cases--
-Use case 1, pots to envelopes-
TODO: describe

-Use case 2, envelopes to pots-

-Use case 3, checking/paycheck to pots-

-Use case 4, pots to checking balance, manual envelope adjustment-
This one might be the most practical. It's also probably one of the easiest to implement. You might want to start with it.


TODO: 
    * How about a UI? 
    * Flesh out the above use cases more.

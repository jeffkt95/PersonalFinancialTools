# PersonalFinancialTools
A set of tools for my personal finances.

I have a testing spreadsheet for development: "Lyons Envelope Testing"

It's now working for the real spreadsheet! I need more testing for weirdness that could happen with sub-envelopes.

TODO: 
    * How about a UI? 
    * DONE Test fail with empty clipboard
    * DONE Put try catch around the whole thing
    * DONE Gracefully handle empty clipboard
    * DONE Check that first line of report says "Budget check"

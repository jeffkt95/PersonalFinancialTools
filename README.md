# PersonalFinancialTools
A set of tools for my personal finances.

I have a testing spreadsheet for development: "Lyons Envelope Testing"

It's now working for the real spreadsheet! I need more testing for weirdness that could happen with sub-envelopes.

TODO: 
    * How about a UI? 
    * Add list of envelopes to ignore. E.g. super-class envelopes that you want the sub-envelopes for. Just Auto for now. We
      instead use Auto:Fuel and Auto:Service
    * Do a total check and report to user!

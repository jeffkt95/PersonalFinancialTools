# PersonalFinancialTools
A set of tools for my personal finances.

I have a testing spreadsheet for development: "Lyons Envelope Testing"

It's now working for the real spreadsheet! I need more testing for weirdness that could happen with sub-envelopes.

How about a UI? 

How will you run it?
    * Try one more time to run it from the spreadsheet.
    * If that doesn't work, put a shortcut on the taskbar.
